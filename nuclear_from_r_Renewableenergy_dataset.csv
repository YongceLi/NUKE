Nuclear power already receives tens of billions of dollars in R&amp;D subsidies every year. Even long-shots like Nuscale got $1.4 Billion from the Department of Energy and they're still a decade out from building their first commercial reactor.


Meanwhile, global annual production of electricity by Wind and Solar surpassed nuclear power last year. A 10 year buildout surpassed a 60 year one. I know which horse I'm hitching my wagon on.",NEU

Nuclear energy is fine. It's technologically viable, safe, low emissions. Yada yada. 

And even 10 years ago, it would have made sense to push to build. 

Now though, renewables are so cheap, that it just doesn't make sense. funding nuclear is now an opportunity cost where more decarbonozation could be done faster and cheaper with wind/solar.",NEU

2) out of ~14000 mtoe energy consumption globally, 7500+ mtoe of energy is consumed by countries which possess nuclear weapons ( i e countries which also possess nuclear enrichment capability ), so your assumption that nuclear recycling creates proliferation risk & that it is not suitable for most of the world  does not make much sense",NEU

Did it prevent Iran from building more centrifuges ? No
